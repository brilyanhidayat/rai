                    Logistics?</a></h4>
                <div class="blog__desc">
                  <p>The key to the success of any logistics contract is good logistics management. The key to good
                    management is the ability to identify the needs of the client and the countries in which the work
                    will take place, as well as being in a position to advise the best way forward. In todayâ€™s
                    international and remote locations, experience and understanding of logistics operations and local
                    networks is vital. With the many years of experience in our team, we have a detailed understanding
                    of the criticality or every aspect of the logistics world.</p>
                  <p> Focus can provide logistics personnel to meet the needs of your company or project. From logistics
                    managers to warehousemen, logistics controllers to transport coordinators, we can assist you. We
                    provide personnel for one-off projects as well as long or short-term agency personnel, assist in the
                    recruitment of permanent staff, or we can manage your logistics department for you.</p>
                  <p>When travelling to a foreign country, most people are nervous of the obstacles that will be there
                    for them to overcome. When a full marine crew travels en-mass to a vessel mobilisation, it is
                    imperative that they arrive on time and safely, especially in a remote location.</p>
                  <p>Focus provides meet-and-greet facilities through our network of specialist companies. From hotel
                    reservations and taxi arrangements to a full pick-up facility, with or without armed guards, this
                    can be arranged.</p>
                  <p>Ever had a last minute requirement for items to be in a country where you do not have a visa to
                    enter? Are you frustrated at having to hand-carry important documents to your client, which takes
                    you out of the office for days? Let Focus help you. Our personnel are available 24-hours-a-day for
                    these important deliveries. This leaves you free to concentrate on your business.</p>
